Greasemonkey script to Make Google Search look "normal" in Firefox

In response to [this post](https://support.google.com/websearch/thread/14821876?hl=en)...

I have created a rudimentary greasemonkey script to modify the google search layout to emulate the way it normally appears in Chrome.

This is one of those you will know it when you need it kind of scripts… as not everyone gets the new layout and those that do might preferer it over the old… to each their own).
